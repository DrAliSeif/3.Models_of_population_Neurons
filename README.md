# 1.all-to-all 100 WB neurons
## Spike rastergram of 100 synaptically coupled WB neurons.

Figure 31.3 shows an ING rhythm generated by 100 WB neurons coupled with inhibitory synapses. Note that it takes longer to reach synchrony than in, for instance, the PING network of Fig. 30.4. In Fig. 31.3, conditions for synchronization are ideal: There is no heterogeneity in external drives, synaptic connectivity is allto-all, and all synapses have the same strength. This is why perfect synchrony is reached in the limit as t → ∞. With a modest level of drive heterogeneity (σI = 0.03), it takes even longer to reach (approximate) synchrony; see Fig. 31.4. A similar effect is seen when 15% of the synaptic connections in Fig. 31.3 are omitted at random (pII = 0.85), and the remaining ones strengthened by the factor 100/85; see Fig. 31.5. As in Chapter 30, this is not primarily an effect of sparseness and randomness per se, but of variations in the total amount of synaptic input per cell; see Fig. 31.6. With greater heterogeneity, the rhythm disappears; see Fig. 31.7, and also exercise 3. For an analysis of the sensitivity of ING rhythms to heterogeneity, see.
